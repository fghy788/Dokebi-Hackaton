# Dokebi-For Hackaton

Dokebi Project Demo for Hackaton<br>
Dokebi is Solana NFT Royalty Donating platfrom with game theory!!<br>

I think Solana NFT royalty problem is not gonna solve easily.<br>
If some marketplace forced royalty users going to other marketplace or going to p2p trade.<br>
So i think people need to donate for own DAOs <br>

But who going to easily donate there money they need profit with Donate<br>
I focus on that!!<br>
Finally i made Donate platform!!<br>
Dokebi have three part of Donate to Earn!!<br>

# Donate 2 Earn
About D2E<br>
Donate to Earn is literally donate for your dao or favorite daos and earn!<br>
How to earn?<br>

If A DAO donate 2.2sol-A DAO receive 1.1sol<br>
If B DAO donate 2sol-B DAO receive 1sol<br>
If C DAO donate 3sol-C DAO receive 1.5sol<br>
If D DAO donate 2sol-D DAO receive 1sol<br>
If E DAO donate 2.4sol-E DAO receive 1.2sol<br>

leftover SOL going to distribute wallet A DAO 1.1sol + B DAO 1sol + C DAO 1.5sol + D DAO 1sol + E DAO 1.2sol<br>
Distribute wallet balance going to 5.8SOL<br>
Distribute wallet SOL going to distribute to rank 1 donater dao = C DAO donaters will receive 5.8SOL almost 2x porfit<br>

# Donate 2 Raffle

# Donate 2 Utility
About D2U<br>
Donate to Utility is Donate DApps for utility what holder want<br>
Donate to Utility like crowdfunding<br>
It has three steps Suggest->Funding->Vote for distirbute<br>

Suggest<br>
If some holder suggest Degod need token<br>

Funding<br>
If Holders think they need token for Degod<br>
Holders going to donate money for Token-suggestion<br>

Vote for distirbute<br>
Let's assume Donating SOL going to 100sol<br>
Let's assume Degod DAO going to made token like $dust<br>
Holders vote if they satisfied<br>
If satisfied holders over than 50% 90%SOL going to Degod DAO and 10% to suggester<br>

This prevent projects going to slow rug.<br>
And 10% to suggester going to made more suggest for their DAO and for own profit<br>
