# Dokebi-For Hackaton

Dokebi Project Demo for Hackaton
Dokebi is Solana NFT Royalty Donating platfrom with game theory!!
I think Solana NFT royalty problem is not gonna solve easily.
If some marketplace forced royalty users going to other marketplace or going to p2p trade.
So i think people need to donate for own DAOs 
But who going to easily donate there money they need profit with Donate
I focus on that!!
Finally i made Donate platform!!
Dokebi have three part of Donate to Earn

# Donate 2 Earn
About D2E
Donate to Earn is literally donate for your dao or favorite daos and earn!
How to earn?

If A DAO donate 2.2sol-A DAO receive 1.1sol
If B DAO donate 2sol-B DAO receive 1sol
If C DAO donate 3sol-C DAO receive 1.5sol
If D DAO donate 2sol-D DAO receive 1sol
If E DAO donate 2.4sol-E DAO receive 1.2sol

leftover SOL going to distribute wallet A DAO 1.1sol + B DAO 1sol + C DAO 1.5sol + D DAO 1sol + E DAO 1.2sol
Distribute wallet balance going to 5.8SOL
Distribute wallet SOL going to distribute to rank 1 donater dao = C DAO donaters will receive 5.8SOL almost 2x porfit

# Donate 2 Raffle
About D2R
Donate Raffle is Raffle DApps for NFTs FP and NFTs Royalty
We open Raffle with NFTs like SMB,FFF,Degod

Every Raffle ticket price is 0.1SOL
If someone buy SMB Raffle ticket
0.07sol to buy other SMB for raffle
0.03sol to SMB DAO

0.07sol to buy other Degod for raffle
0.03sol to Degod DAO

Donate Raffle mechanism
Raffle get hyped->Gather more money->Sweep NFTs floor for raffle nfts->FP going high->
Raffle get hyped->Donate more->everyone can earn with this mechanism DAO,NFT Holder

# Donate 2 Utility
About D2U
Donate to Utility is Donate DApps for utility what holder want
Donate to Utility like crowdfunding
It has three steps Suggest->Funding->Vote for distirbute

Suggest
If some holder suggest Degod need token

Funding
If Holders think they need token for Degod
Holders going to donate money for Token-suggestion

Vote for distirbute
Let's assume Donating SOL going to 100sol
Let's assume Degod DAO going to made token like $dust
Holders vote if they satisfied
If satisfied holders over than 50% 90%SOL going to Degod DAO and 10% to suggester

This prevent projects going to slow rug.
And 10% to suggester going to made more suggest for their DAO and for own profit
