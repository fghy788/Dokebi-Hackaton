# üëã Dokebi-Intro

Dokebi is platform Solana NFT Game & Donate DApp for solana DAOs <br>

I think Solana NFT royalty problem is not gonna solve easily.<br>
If some marketplace forced royalty users just going to other marketplace or going to p2p trade.<br>
If someone break unpaid royalty NFTs? It is worst...NFT traders will lose money without reason or by mistake and nobody never care about it.<br>
It can make people leave NFT ecosystem.<br>
Forced block to DAO or Discord? some people just trading not join the DAO... It makes DAO getting smaller...without pay and without solution.<br>

I really think hard what can be helpful to NFTs and solana ecosystem.<br>
So I finally think about Donate platform for solana NFTs and ecosystem.<br>

But who going to easily donate there money??<br>
I focus on that!! So i made Donate to earn model. This is my first project for Dokebi<br>
Donate to Earn!!<br>
Dokebi has three part of Donate to Earn and there will be more Game or Donate to Earn model for DAOs<br>

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Donate 2 Utility

About D2U<br>
Donate to Utility is donate for holder want utility <br>
Donate to Utility concepts like crowdfunding<br>

It has three steps Suggest->Funding->Vote for distirbute<br>

Suggest<br>
If some holder suggest Degod need token<br>

Funding<br>
If Holders think they need token for Degod<br>
Holders going to donate money for Token-suggestion<br>

Vote for distirbute<br>
Let's assume Donating SOL going to 100sol<br>
Let's assume Degod DAO going to made token like $dust<br>
Holders vote if they satisfied<br>
If satisfied holders over than 50% 90%SOL going to Degod DAO and 10% to suggester<br>

It prevent projects going to slow rug.<br>
And 10% SOL to suggester going to made more suggest for their DAO and for their own profit<br>

# üïπÔ∏è Partnership & Game DApps
I will made Game DApps for partnership DAO.<br>
going to make Game like Degencoinflip but If i made game for GGSG 50%of game DApp profit is going to GGSG DAO or GGSG holders.<br>
Lest of 50% is going to Dokebi Holders.<br>
It will made people come to Dokebi page for playing games and they will donate to DAOs for earn<br>
It can make NFTs fun place again and DAO are going more stronger with their DApps games.<br>
The most positive effect is DAOs didn't have to change their roadmap for earn royalties.<br>

# üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why Dokebi need NFT?
NFTs make people stick together with DAO. we need advertise for people come to donate and if dokebi floor price is going up people more interested in what dokebi is that is one of marketing point for make people donate.<br>
Dokebi DAO member trying to advertise or make people donate for their own profit(fee from dokebi-platform/higher Floor price of dokebiNFT).<br>

# üèñÔ∏è Final and Marketing

I started developing Dokebi platform Nov 19.<br>
<img width="780" alt="·Ñâ·Ö≥·Ñè·Ö≥·ÑÖ·Öµ·Ü´·Ñâ·Ö£·Ü∫ 2022-12-07 ·Ñã·Ö©·Ñå·Ö•·Ü´ 3 21 13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81508501/205991045-46bce23b-e23a-4a15-bcb0-2843d2faeabb.png">

Finally deploy our first project of Dokebi Donate to Earn Dev 04.<br>
Next day I introduce my platform at Dev05 MonkeMondaySpotlight and watch people love my Idea.<br>
Already get SMB, Famous Fox Federation, DegenApe and GGSG DAO wallet address and support from founders and mods.<br>
I'm Going to partnership with more projects with game DApps and Donate for them.<br>
Make DAO and NFTs for advertising It makes NFT holders get hyped for donating.<br>

Imagine NFT holders donate for their DAO and nobody care about royalty.<br>
People don't have to see other marketplace for 0% royalty trade, people can only see ME without buying from scam site or buying rugged NFTs and dont have to do dangerous p2p trading.<br>
Nobody care about royalty will be really helpful to solana NFT ecosystem and many other chain will envy solana NFT ecosystem.<br>

This is what i focus on and want to made for!!<br>
